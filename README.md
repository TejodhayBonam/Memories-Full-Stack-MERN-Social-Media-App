## Full Stack MERN Social Media App


- Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB I've built a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

- "Memories" is a social media app to post your memories and those will create their account can also be able to post their memories and other people can also see it. 
- It is a full stack MERN application and there is an application that can be used by many people and, will be able to share their memories with other people and they can like, one of the important features is that who post memories that person and only delete it, other people can see and like the other memory post.




Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
